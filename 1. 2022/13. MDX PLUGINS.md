# SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING FOR CODE AND OTHER PLUGINS

***
***

BUT IN HERE I WILL ALSO TELL YOU HOW TO AUTOLINK HEADINGS INSIDE MDX

***

SOMETHING HELPFUL BUT I DIDN'T USE IT

<https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/build-time-code-blocks-with-rehype-prism-and-mdx>

***

I THINK I AM GOING TO USE rehype PLUGINS

I FOUND THIS TUTORIAL BUT I USED **PRISM** ONCE, ON MY OWN WITHOUT ANY PREBUILD SOLUTION AND I THINK I OVERCOMPLICATED A LOT OF THINGS

<https://www.peterlunch.com/blog/prism-react-render-nextjs>

MAYBE HERE YOU CAN FIND HELPFUL THINGS

LEE ROBINSON USED rehype PLUGINS

<https://leerob.io/blog/mdx#mdx-plugins>

<https://leerob.io/blog/mdx#better-syntax-highlighting>

**ONE OF THE PLUGINS THAT CAOUGHT MY ATTENTION IS [`rehype-prism-plus`](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus#readme) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-prism-plus/v/1.0.0)**

I STILL NEED TO DECIDE IF I'M GOING TO USE `rehype-prism` OR `rehype-prism-plus`

# I INSTALLED SOME OF THE PLUGINS LEE ROBINSON ALSO INSTALLED

`rehype`

FOR autolink literals, footnotes, strikethrough, tables, tasklists

`remark-gfm` <https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm>

FOR CODE TITLES

`rehype-code-titles` <https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles>

FOR AUTOLINK HEADINGS

`rehype-slug` (we need this for autolink to work)

`rehype-autolink-headings` <https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings>

FOR CODE (PRE TAG I THINK) SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING

`rehype-prism-plus` <https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus>

<!--  -->

```
yarn add remark-gfm rehype rehype-code-titles rehype-autolink-headings rehype-prism-plus
```

WE ARE GOING TO USE THIS PLUGINS LIKE IT IS SPECIFIED HERE:

<https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#apis>

# BUT THIS DOESN'T WORK AND I HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS; SO I HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE; I WILL USE `mdx-bundler`; AND I'M CONSIDERING USING `contentlayer` (BUT UNLIKELY THAT I'LL USE SECOND ONE) 

REHYPE AND REMARK PLUGINS ARE JUST NOT WORKING WITH serialize FROM `next-mdx-remote`

SO I'M GOING TO USE SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD `next-mdx-remote`

[mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)

***

SOMETIMES YOU CAN CONSIDER [content-layer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), BUT NOT NOW IN THIS INSTANCE

***

**LETS USE `mdx-bundler`**

# STILL PLUGINS NOT WORKING

NEED TO CHECK VERSIONS FOT THES PLUGINS

<https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/blob/master/lib/mdx.js>

# PLUGINS STILL DON'T WORK, SO I NEED TO MANUALLY DEFINE PROCESSING ON MDX STRING

FOR THIS PURPOSES I WILL INSTALL ONE MORE PACKAGE CALLED `unified`

# I MANAGED TO MAKE THINGS WORK

ORDER OF PLUGINS AND SOME MISSING PLUGINS WERE A PROBLEMATIC THING

# THEMES FOR SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING

<https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes>

# FIXED THE PROBLEM

PROBLEM WAS WIDTH OF CODE LINE

WIDTH SHOULDN'T BE 100%; I DID IT 99.8%
