# I WANT A LITTLE BIT TO EXPLORE WEBHOOKS AND HOW TO SECURE MY API ROUTE THAT IS RECEIVING REQUESTS FROM THE WEBHOOK 

FOR START I WANT TO EXPLORE GITHUB WEBHOOKS AND I WANT TO EXPLORE HOW CAN I USE THESE WEBHOOKS IN MY WORKFLOW

SOME HELPFUL RESOURCES:

<https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/getting-started-github-webhooks#what-are-github-webhooks>

[I EXPLORED MORE ABOUT WEBHOOKS](/__NOTES/12.%20WEBHOOKS.md) (GITHUB OR SANITY ONES)

THERE IS NOTHING CONCERNING THERE, CHECK IT OUT IF YOU WANT

# NOW LETS SEE HOW WE CAN USE "crypto" PACKAGE AND HOW CAN WE IMPLEMENT SOME METHODS FROM THAT PACKAGE IN OUR API ROUTES

I DID [EXPLORE "crypto"](/__NOTES/20.%20crypto.md)

SO YOU CAN START LEARNING THERE

# AND ABOUT WHAT WE LEARNED AND WHAT WE IMPLEMENTED ABOUT WEBHOOKS AND `crypto` YOU CAN START LOOKING AT THIS API ROUTE

[check this out](/src/pages/api/gh-hook.ts)

SEE WHAT IT DOES AND SEE WHAT I'M IMPORTING AND USING, BECAUSE I WILL MAKE ALL THOSE THINGS

# ALSO I AM GOING TO CONSULT SOME EXAMPLES FROM THIS CODEBSE

YES THIS LINK IS ABOUT ISR BUT IT HAS A GOOD USAGE OF crypto GITHUB BHOOKS
