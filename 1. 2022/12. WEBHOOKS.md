# I AM USING WEBHOOKS IN THIS PROJECT

IN THIS SHORT MD DOC I WILL CONCISELY EXPLAIN HOW AND WHERE I'M USING WEBHOOKS

AND I WILL TELL WHAT WEBHHOKS I AM USING AND WHY

# SANITY WEBHOOKS

MORE ABOUT THEM READ IN THE DOCUMENTATION

<https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks>

HOW I'M USING THEM, YOU CAN [READ HERE](/__NOTES/__WORKSTEPS/5.%20WEBHOOKS%20AND%20ngrok.md)

# GITHUB WEBHOOKS

THERE ARE TWO WAYS I CAN USE WEBHOOKS FOR GITHUB

YOU CAN:

- REGISTER A GITHUB APP (I AM TALKING ABOUT YOUR PROFILE DASBOARD `Settings` --> `Developer Settings` --> `Github Apps` --> `New Github App`), AND THERE YOU CAN DEFINE A WEBHOOK; **AFTER CREATION OF THE APP YOU MUST CLICK ON APP YOU MADE, AND PROCEED WITH INSTALLATION OF YOUR APP FOR SELECTED REPOSITORIES IN YOUR GITHUB PROFILE**

- OR YOU CAN GO DIRECTLY TO A REPO FOR WHOOM YOU WANT TO DEFINE A WEBHOOK (`Your repo` --> `Settings` --> `Webhooks` --> `Add Webhook`)

NEXT, I WILL EXPLAIN MORE DETAILED HOW YOU CREATE WEBHOOKS LIKE I MENTIONED IN THIS TWO BULLETS ABOVE

# 1. CREATING GITHUB APP (WITH WEBHOOK CREATION) IN YOUR GITHUB PROFILE

THIS IS A EXAMPLE OF CREATING A WEBHOOK FOR ISSUE EVENT ON YOUR REPO

1. Provide the URL of your deployed application for Homepage URL
1. Ensure Webhook "Active" is checked
1. Add `<your-site>/your api path` as the Webhook URL
1. Create a Webhook secret and add it to .env.local as GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
1. Give "Read Only" access to Issues
1. Subscribe to "Issues" events

AFTER THAT

1. Add the App ID to .env.local as GITHUB_APP_ID
1. Generate a private key and add it to .env.local as GITHUB_APP_PK_PEM (WHEN YOU CREATE APP YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO GENERATE KEY WHICH YOU'LL DOWNLOAD AND YOU CAN USE IT)
1. Install the newly created GitHub App for your repo (THE WAY I EXPLAIN TO YOU EARLIER)

YOUR APP SHOULD BE HERE

`https://github.com/settings/apps/<your-app-name>/installations`

# 2. CREATING WEBHOOK DIRECTLY IN REPO

THIS IS EVEN SIMPLER, SO I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN

I PREFER CREATING IT THROUGH APP, BECAUSE WITH UPP YOU CAN REUSE SAME WEBHOOK FOR MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES

# I DON'T WANT TO EXPLAIN YOU HOW YOU CAN USE ngrok AND SIMILAR SERVICES BECAUSE THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR

I THINK [I ALREADY EXPLAIN THAT](/__NOTES/__WORKSTEPS/5.%20WEBHOOKS%20AND%20ngrok.md)

# I WILL SHOW YOU HERE HOW YOU WOULD AUTHENTICATE YOUR WEB HOOK

WHEN I SAY HOW TO AUTHENTICATE I THINK THAT YOU ACTUALLY CHECK IF YOUR WEBHOOK IS ACTUALLY THE ONE SENDING REQUEST TO YOUR API ROUTE

THIS IS SOME OF YOURS API ROUTE

```
src/pages/api/gh-hook.ts
```

**THIS ROUTE IS SPECIFIED IN WEBHOOK TO BE THE ROUTE TO WHOOM YOUR GITHUB WEBHOOK IS SENDING REQUESTS**

```ts
import { createHmac } from "crypto";
import nc from "next-connect";
import type {
  IssuesOpenedEvent,
  IssuesClosedEvent,
} from "@octokit/webhooks-types";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

const handler = nc<NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse>();

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};

handler.post(async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const rawBody = await getRawBody(req);
    // WE ACTULLY DON'T NEED A PARSED BODY
    // WE ONLY NED RAW BODY AS A hmac CONTENT (DATA FOR HMAC TO HASH)
    const parsedBody: IssuesOpenedEvent | IssuesClosedEvent =
      JSON.parse(rawBody);

    console.log(req.headers);
    // WE NEED TO VALIDATE IF WE ARE RECEIVING REQUEST FROM GITHUB
    // SO WE NEED TO REBUILD HASH (HMAC)
    //  WE NEED THIS HEADER    x-hub-signature-256
    // IT IS A HASH THAT IS BUILD TOGETHER WITH OUR SECRET
    // WHICH IS USED AS SALT

    const signature = req.headers["x-hub-signature-256"];

    if (signature) {
      //
      const computedSignature =
        // WE NEED TO ADD THIS IN FRONT OF SIGNATURE
        "sha256=" +
        // BECAUSE ORIGINAL SIGNATURE HAS MENTIONED "sha256=" PREPENDED
        createHmac("sha256", process.env.GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET as string)
          .update(rawBody)
          .digest("hex");

      //
      console.log(computedSignature === signature);

      // IF THIS IS FALSE WE RECIEVED REQUEST FROM SOME
      // BAD PARTY, BECAUSE NOONE SHOULD SEND REQUEST TO THIS API
      // IT SHOULD BE ONLY OUR WEBHOO KSENDING REQUESTS TO
      // THIS API ROUTE
      if (computedSignature !== signature) {
        return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized!");
      }

      return res.status(200).json("Everything is ok");
    } else {
      return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized!");
    }
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(500).send("something went wrong");
  }
});

function getRawBody(req: NextApiRequest): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const bodyChunks: Uint8Array[] = [];

    req.on("data", (chunk: Uint8Array) => {
      bodyChunks.push(chunk);
    });

    req.on("end", () => {
      const rawBody = Buffer.concat(bodyChunks).toString("utf8");

      resolve(rawBody);
    });

    req.on("error", (err) => {
      console.error(err);

      reject(
        "Something went wrong and body data of request, didn't came to its destination!"
      );
    });
  });
}

export default handler;
```

**TO TEST THIS YOU CAN SEND REQUEST FROM HTTPIE, WHICH SHOULD FAIL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COME FROM WEBHOOK**

```
http POST :3000/api/gh-hook  hello="my world"
```

THIS FAILED AS EXPECTED

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 13
Date: Wed, 15 Jun 2022 10:29:23 GMT
ETag: "d-FzXsNE8VPR0tB1NkIvTbzWHBzlg"
Keep-Alive: timeout=5

Unauthorized!
```

**BUT IF YOU MAKE REQUEST BY GOING IN YOUR GITHUB REPO, AND CLOSING OR OPENING A NEW ISSUE, REQUEST SHOULD BE AUTHENTICATED; WHICH I TESTED OUT AND EVERYTHING IS OK**
