# I WANT TO EXPLORE HOW BODY LOOKS WHEN YOU DON'T US BODY PARSER ON YOUR API ROUTE

I SHOULD DO ENTIRE "NETWORKING AND STREAMS" WORKSHOP TO UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE BUFFERS OR THINGS LIKE STREAMS

BUT FOR NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW WOULD YOU USE RAW BODY FROM REQUEST, `BECAUSE YOU WERE USING BODY PARSER WITH EXPRESS OR next-connect`

## IN EXPRESS AND NEXT CONNECT BODY PARSER MIDDLEWARE IS USED BY DEFAULT

IT PARSES BODY FOR YOU AND INSERTS PARSED body PROPERTY ON REQUEST

BUT BODY DOESN'T COME WITH REQUEST; I GUESS BODY OR REQUEST COMMES IN PACKETS THROUGH NETWORK

# THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD DEAL WITH RAW BODY, OR TO SAY BETTER THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD USE EVENTS OF THE REQUST TO PARSE BODY BY YOURSELF

SEE THIS EXAMPLE HERE

```
src/pages/api/gh-hook.ts
```

```ts
import nc from "next-connect";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

const handler = nc<NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse>();

// THIS IS HOW WE DISABLE USAGE OF BODY PARSER
// THIS MEANS THAT FOR THIS HANDLER BODY PARSER WOILL NOT BE USED
// IMPORTANT!
//                    req.body       WILL BE undefined

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};

// LETS BUILD HELPER THAT WOULD TAKE REQUEST
// AND BY PLAYING AROUND WITH EVENTS (EVENTS OF REQUEST), BUFFERS
//  AND Uint8Arrays, WE WOULD "REBUILD BODY" TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT
//  BODY THAT IS SENT WITH REQUEST TO OUR API

function getRawBody(req: NextApiRequest): Promise<string> {
  // RETURNING PROMISE HOPEFULLY WITH
  // STRINGIFIED BODY

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // BODY COMES TO DESTINATION, NOT IN ONE PART
    // IT COMES AS CHUNKS OF Uint8ArrayS
    // WE WILL "CATCH" THOSE CHUNKS IN THIS ARRAY
    const bodyChunks: Uint8Array[] = [];

    // AS CHUNKS OF DAT COMES WE PLACE THEM IN ARRAY
    req.on("data", (chunk: Uint8Array) => {
      bodyChunks.push(chunk);
    });

    // WHEN REQUEST REACHES ITS END WE MAKE BUFFER
    // FROM THOSE UINT8 ARRAYS
    req.on("end", () => {
      // SO THIS IS RAW BODY
      // IT IS ACTUAL STRINGIFIED DATA THAT WAS ORIGINALLY SENT
      // IN ONE PIECE WITH REQUEST
      const rawBody = Buffer.concat(bodyChunks).toString("utf8");

      // MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE SENT DATA THAT IS IN JSON FORMAT
      // SO THIS WOULD BE STRING IN JSON FORMAT
      resolve(rawBody);
    });

    // LETS HANDLE IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
    // SOME ERROR DURING SENDING PACKETS
    req.on("error", (err) => {
      console.error(err);
      // I CAN REJECT PROMISE OVER HERE
      reject(
        "Something went wrong and body data of request, didn't came to its destination!"
      );
    });
  });
}

// HANDLING POST REQUESTS
handler.post(async (req, res) => {
  //
  // I TOLD YOU EARLIER THIS IS undefined
  //  req.body        doesn't exists

  try {
    //
    // LETS "BUILD" BODY FROM MENTIONED CHUNKS
    const body = await getRawBody(req);

    console.log(typeof body); // THIS SHOULD BE "string"

    // WE CAN PARSE BODY
    const parsedBody = JSON.parse(body);

    console.log(typeof parsedBody); // THIS SHOULD BE "object"

    //
    // LETS SEND BODY
    return res.status(200).json({ body: parsedBody });
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(500).send("something went wrong");
  }
});

export default handler;

```
