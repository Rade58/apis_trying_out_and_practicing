# I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY IN NODEJS

I AM FOLLOWING THIS TUTORIAL: <https://fireship.io/lessons/node-crypto-examples/>

I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT `HASHING` `ENCRYPTION` AND `SIGNING` CRYPTOGRAPHIC CONCEPTS

HERE ARE THE EXAMPLES:

<https://github.com/fireship-io/node-crypto-examples>

# 1. HASHING CONCEPT

HASHING MEANS: "CHOP AND MIX" AND HA CULINARY ROOTS

INPUT **CAN HAVE ANY LENGTH**

INPUT GETS PASSED TO HASHING FUNCTION (OF YOUR CHOICE ("md5" (deprecated), "sha" (good one), "argon2"(even better, but can't be used in nodejs)))

HASHING FUNCTION PRODUCES `ALWAYS THE SAME OUTPUT` (**WITH FIXED LENGTH**) `FOR GIVEN INPUT`

FAST TO COMPUTE

**HARD FOR COMPUTER TO REVERSE ENGINEER**

EXAMPLE (NODEJS):

`__NO_OPS/crypto-practice/1_hashing.js`

```js
const { createHash } = require("crypto");

// CREATING CUSTOM FUCTION WHICH TAKES STRING
// AS AN INPUT, AND CREATES HASHED STRING AS AAN OUTPUT

// I WILL USE SECURE HASH ALGORYTHM 2 CREATED BY "SOME" AGENCY OF THE
// USA

// IT RETURNS 256-BIT DIGEST

const hashIt = (input) => {
  // PAY ATTENTION HOW I USED THESE METHODS
  // BETTER TO SAY: LOOK HOW THEY ARE CHAINED
  // update() TAKES INPUT
  // AND digest() METHOD IS THE ONE THAT CREATES DIGEST
  // A FIXED LENGTH STRING WE TALKED ABOUT

  // BUT DIGEST ALSO CAN BE IN DIFFERENT FORMATS, LIKE hex OR base64
  // OR base64 url
  // IN THIS CASE WE DID CHOOSE TO CREATE DIGEST IN HEXADECIMAL FORMAT

  return createHash("sha256").update(input).digest("hex");
};

// CREATE TWO HASHES WITH SAME INPUT

const hashOne = hashIt("hedera");

const hashTwo = hashIt("hedera");

console.log({ hashOne, hashTwo });

// THIS NEEDS TO BE EQUAL, LIKE I SAID, SAME VALUE CREATES SAME HASH

console.log(hashOne === hashTwo); // ---> true
```

WHEN WE DID THIS

```
node __NO_OPS/crypto-practice/1_hashing.js
```

WE GOT THIS OUTPUT

```bash
{
  hashOne: '6b4afa07ed23a29bcb2f13db87045e613cf9421a92de91aebd1eea13a618e5d6',
  hashTwo: '6b4afa07ed23a29bcb2f13db87045e613cf9421a92de91aebd1eea13a618e5d6'
}
true
```

**I THINK YOU ALREADY TOOK TO YOUR MIND (IN A MOMENT YOU COMPARED TWO HASHES), WHERE WOULD `SECRET` BE INTRODUCED** (BUT DON'T SWEAT IT, THAT ALSO WOULDN'T BE GOOD ENOUGH)

# 2. WE INTRODUCE `SALT` (RANDOMLY GENEATED DATA), BECAUSE HASHING BY ITSELF IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR STORING PASSWORD IN A DATABASE FOR EXAMPLE 

HASHING IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE IT ALWAYS RETURNS THE SAME VALUE, LIKE YOU SAW

WE NEED RANDOMLY GENERATED THING CALLED SALT

SEE EXAMPLE

```
__NO_OPS/crypto-practice/2_salting.js
```

```js
// I WILL USE ONE FUNCTION CALLED scryptSync
// I WILL USE IT FOR HASHING, WHEN WE CREATE signUp FUNCTION

// I WILL USE IT BECAUSE:

//     `Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function
// that is designed to be expensive computationally and memory-wise
//  in order to make brute-force attacks unrewarding.`

// AND I AM GOING TO USE FUNCTION CALLED    randomBytes

// randomBytes generates cryptographically strong pseudorandom data.
//  The size argument is a number indicating the number
//  of bytes to generate.

// ---------------
// ALSO FOR CHECKING EQUALITY (WHEN WE BUILD logIn FUNCTION)
//  I AM GOING TO USE timingSafeEqual
// BECAUSE:
//          `This function is based on a constant-time algorithm.
//             Returns true if a is equal to b, without leaking
//             timing information that would allow an attacker
//             to guess one of the values.
//            This is suitable for comparing HMAC digests or secret
//             values like authentication cookies or capability urls.`

const { scryptSync, randomBytes, timingSafeEqual } = require("crypto");

// THIS IS GOING TO SIMULATE A DATBASE OF USER
//
const users = {};

// NOW I WILL CREATE SIGNUP FUNCTION
// AS YOU KNOW RGUMENTS ARE email AND password THAT USER PROVIDED
// WHEN HE WANTED TO OPEN ACCOUNT IN OUR PPLICATION
const signup = (email, password) => {
  //  WHEN USERS SIGNUP WE GENERATE SALT
  // SO THIS IS HOW WE USE SALTING
  // WE CREATE RANDOM TRING
  const salt = randomBytes(16).toString("hex");

  // WE CREATE HASHED PASSWORD WITH scryptSync METHOD

  // WE SET IT KEYLEN 64
  // THIS METHOD MAKES MUCH HARDER FOR BRUTE FORCE TO CRACK IT
  // BECAUSE IT IS COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE

  // scryptSync
  // IT IS ALSO USED PROOF OF WOORK ALGORYTHM USED
  // IN CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING

  // BUT FROM THE METHOD WE ARE GOING TO GET Buffer
  // WE NEED TO TURN THAT BUFFER TO HEX STRING

  const hashedPasswordBuffer = scryptSync(password, salt, 64);

  const hashedPasswordHex = hashedPasswordBuffer.toString("hex");

  // THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD STORE IN A DATBASE

  const user = {
    // AN EMAIL
    email,
    // AND PREPENDED SALT ON A HASHED PASSWORD

    password: `${salt}:${hashedPasswordHex}`,
  };

  users[email] = user;
};

// LETS CREATE login FUNCTION

// IT TAKES
const login = (email, password) => {
  // FIRST LETS TAKE A USER FROM THE DATABASE

  const user = users[email];
  // THEN WE CAN GET A SALT AND A HASH FROM OUR PASSWORD

  const [salt, hashHex] = user.password.split(":");

  // LETS RUN AGAIN HSHING ALGORYTHM
  // UF USER DID MAKE A MISTAKE HERE AND PROVIDED AN OLD
  // PASSWORD, WE WOULD HAVE COMPLETELLY DIIFFERENT HASH

  // DON'T FORGET THAT scryptSync RETURNS Buffer

  // BUT THIS TIME WE DON'T NEED HEX BECAUSE WE WILL COMPARE BUFFERS

  // AND WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE USE password ARGUMENT OF THE FUNCTION
  // AND THIS TIME WE ARE USING salt THAT WE READ FROM THE DATBASE

  const passBufferOne = scryptSync(password, salt, 64);

  // LETS CREATE Buffer FROM THE HEX THAAT WE READ FROM THE DATBASE
  const passBufferTwo = Buffer.from(hashHex, "hex");

  // LETS NOW COMPARE
  // WE ARE GOING TO USE THIS TIME SENSITIVE COMPARE FUNCTION
  const booleanValue = timingSafeEqual(passBufferOne, passBufferTwo);

  return booleanValue;
};

// MOZEMO DA ISPROBAMO OVE DVE FUNKCIJE

// USER SIGNING UP
signup("someone@mail.com", "foobarpass");

// USER LOGGING IN BUT HE FORGOT HIS PASSWORD
// AND HW PUT THE WRONG ONE

// THIS SHOULD BE false
const signedInOne = login("someone@mail.com", "bazquxpass");

// USER LOGGING IN WITH THE RIGHT PASSWORD
// THIS SHOULD BE true
const signedInTwo = login("someone@mail.com", "foobarpass");

console.log({ signedInOne, signedInTwo }); // --> { signedInOne: false, signedInTwo: true }

```

OK, WE LEARNED WHAT SALT IS

# 3. `HMAC`, A HASH-BASED MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE

**QUICK DEFFINITION WOULD BE THAT IT'S A HASH THAT ALSO REQUIRES A PASSWORD**

SAM PERSON THAT CREATES SIGNATURE, MUST HAVE CORRESPONDING PASSWORD OR A KEY

GOOD EXAMPLE FOR THIS IS **JWT** OR `JSON WEB TOKEN`, YOU USED BEFORE

LETS NOW PLAY A LITTLE BIT WITH HMAC

FILE: `__NO_OPS/crypto-practice/3_hmac.js`

```js
// A SIMILAR METHOD LIKE createHash WE USED EARLIER
// BUT THIS METHOD REQUIRES A KEY (A SECRET) WHEN CREATING HASH
const { createHmac } = require("crypto");

// HERE IS A SECRET
const secretKey = "safemoon";

// HERE IS A VALUE WE WANT TO HASH
const message = "ðŸ¤Œ Hello my name is Paulie Waluts";

// WE CREATE HMAC LIKE THIS (CHAINING LIKE WITH createHash)
const hmac =
  // FIRST WE PICK ALGORYTHM AND GIVE THE SECRET
  createHmac("sha256", secretKey)
    // THEN WE CHAIN VALUE WE WANT TO HASH
    .update(message)
    // THEN CREATE ACTUAL HMAC IN FORMAT WE WANT, I CHOOSE HEX
    .digest("hex");

// IMPORTANT THING TO NOTICE:
//    WE WOULD CREATE SAME HASH IF WE USED SAME SECRET KEY

// IF WE WOULD CHANGE SECRET KEY, WE WOULD CREATE A COMPLETELLY DIFFERENT
// HASH

// THIS IS A DIFFERENT HASH THAN ONE ABOVE

const otherSecretKey = "hedera";

const differentHmac = createHmac("sha256", otherSecretKey)
  .update(message)
  .digest("hex");

// THIS SHOULD PRODUCE false

console.log(hmac === differentHmac);
```

YOU NOTICED IN ABOVE EXAMPLE IS HOW WE ARE NOT ABLE TO READ ORIGINAL MESSAGE, WE WERENT DOING THAT AT ALL, WE WERE JUST HASHING AND COMPARING HASHES; WELL NEXT THING WE ARE GOING TO DO IS LEARN HOW WE CAN SHARE A SECRET WITH SOMEONE, AND ALLOW THEM TO READ ORIGINAL MESSAGE

# 4. SYMETRIC ENCRYPTION

ENRYPTION MEANS EXACTLY THIS: 

- `WE TAKE A MESSAGE, WE SCRAMBLE UP BYTIES OF THAT MESSAGE IN SOME MANNER, TO MAKE IT UNREADABLE`, THAT UNREADABLE THING IS CALLED **CIPHER TEXT**

- `BUT WE ALSO CREATE SHARED KEY, WE CAN GIVE SOMEONE TO DECRYT THE CIPHER TEXT`

**IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE TO MIND IS THAT CREATION OF `CIPHER TEXT` IS `RANDOMIZED`; WE SHOULD ALWAYS GET DIFFERENT CIPHER THEXT WHEN ENCRYPTING**

WHAT IS THEN SYMETRIC ENCRYPTION?

**SYMETRIC ENCRYPTION** MEANS THAT SHARED PASSWORD (SHARED KEY) SHOULD BE PRODUCED AND SHARED BETWEN A SENDER AND RECEIVER OF THE MESSAGE

LETS DO SOME PRACTICE WITH SYMETRIC ENCRYPTION

FILE: `__NO_OPS/crypto-practice/4_symetric_encryption.js`

```js
// WE ARE GOING TO USE METHODS FOR CREATING CIPHER, ALSO FOR
// CREATING DECRYPTER

// `iv` IN THEIR NAMES MEAN "INITIAL VECTOR"
const { createCipheriv, createDecipheriv, randomBytes } = require("crypto");

// OK, FIRST WE HAVE INITIAL MESSAGEE IN HERE
// A MESSAGE WE WANT TO SHARE, LIKE I SAID
const message = "I'm walking here!";

// WE DEFINE A KAY THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SHARED KEY
// WE TALKED ABOUT

const key = randomBytes(32);

// WE ALSO CREATED `INITIAL VECTOR`
// THIS IS GOING TO RANDOMIZE OUTPUT WHEN IT'S ENCYPTED, SO IDENTICAL
// SEQUENCE OF TEXT WILL NEVER PRODUCE EXACTLY SAME CIPHER TEXT
// THIS WILL MAKE MORE DIFFICULT FOR A HACKEER TO BREAK THE ENCRYPTION
const iv = randomBytes(16); // 16 random bytes

// LETS CREATE THE CIPHER
// LIKE YOU SEE IT USES DIFFERENT ALGORYTHM THAN PREVIOUS METHODS
// ALSO I USED ALGORYTHM THAT TYPSCRIPT DIDN'T SHOW ME THAT EXIST (I USED ALGORYTHM TUTORIAL TOLD ME TO DO)
const cipher = createCipheriv("aes256", key, iv);

// LETS DO ENCRYPTION
// THIS IS GOING TO BE STRING
const encryptedMessage =
  // DONT USE utf-8, USE utf8 INSTEAD
  cipher.update(message, "utf8", "hex") +
  //  BUT THIS CONCATNATION IS WHAT IS STRANGE TO ME, BECAUSE
  // THIS REPRESENTS END OF THE cipher AND cipher CAN'T BE
  // USED ANYMORE
  cipher.final("hex");
// TO BE CLEAR, I KNOW WHAT final DOES, BUT WHY DO CONCATENATE?
// IT DOESN'T METTER AFTER ALL FOR ME, IT MATTER THAT IT WORKS

// IF I TRIED USING cipher TO ENCRYPT ANOTHER MESSAGE, IT WOULD FAIL
// ERROR WOULD BE THROWN BECAUSE WE USED FINAL

// YOU CAN USE CIPHER TO ENCRYPT THE MESSAGE OR YOU CAN ENCRYPT
// MULTIPLE MESSAGES IF YOU WANT
// MESSAGES AS YOU WANT; BUT I'M NOT GOING TO USE THAT, SINCE
// IT WOULD THROW ERROR

// BUT IF YOU WANT TO USE IT IN FUTER, TRY ENCRYPTING, MULTIPLE
// MESSEGES, THAT;S MEANS YOU WILL USE update METHOD MULTIPLE TIMES
// TO CREATE ENCRYPTED MESSAGES WITH SAME CIPHER
// AND ONLY THEN AFTER WE FINISH YOU CAN CALL AND APPEND final METHOD

// YOU'LL GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS   // --> ff13e5aee9ce55f037413eb565ee7cfb4f
console.log(encryptedMessage);

// LET CREATE
// DECYPHER
// SAME ARGUMENTS AS WHN WE WERE CREATING cipher
const decipher = createDecipheriv("aes256", key, iv);

// LETS DECRYPT
// PAT ATTENTION THAT WE USE final HERE TOO TO DISABLE
// DECYPHER, SAME SO IT CAN'T BE USED AFTER THIS, SAME AS WE DID WITH cypher

// BUT THIS TIME YOU CALL final WITH "utf8" ARGUMENT

const decryptedMessage =
  decipher.update(encryptedMessage, "hex", "utf-8") + decipher.final("utf8");

// decipher.final("utf8");

console.log(decryptedMessage); // --> I'm walking here!

```

**BUT THIS APPROACH IS NOT VERY PRACTICAL SINCE SENDER AND RECEIVER NEED TO SHARE A MESSAGE**; THAT IS WHY PUBLIC KEY CRYPTO SYSTEM IS INVENTED; WE ARE GOING TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THAT NEXT

# 5. KEYPAIRS

INSTEAD OF USING ONE KEY, WWITH THIS APPROACH WE ARE USING MATEMATICALLY LINKED PUBLIC KKEY AND THE PRIVATE KEY

PRIVATE KEY SHOULD BE ALWAYS KEPT SECRET, WHILE PUBLIC ONE CAN BE SHARED WITH OTHER PEOPLE

OK, LETS DO AN EXAMPLE

```
__NO_OPS/crypto-practice/5_keypairs.js
```

```js
const { generateKeyPairSync } = require("crypto");

// WE USE METHOD ABOVE FOR GENERATING KEY PAIRS
// WE PICKED RSA WHICH MEANS RIVEST-SHAMIR-ADLEMAN
const { publicKey, privateKey } = generateKeyPairSync("rsa", {
  // YOU CAN DEFINE BUNCH OF SETTING
  // LIKE LENGHTOF KEY IN BITS
  modulusLength: 2048,
  publicKeyEncoding: {
    type: "spki", // RECOMMENDED BY NODJS DOCS
    // WE WANT THIS KEY TO BE IN FORMAT pem (PRIVACY ENHANCED MAIL)
    format: "pem", // IT IS A BASE64 FORMAT
  },
  privateKeyEncoding: {
    type: "pkcs8",
    format: "pem",
    // WE CAN ADD passphrase AND cipher FOR OUR PRIVATE
    // KEY, TO ENHANCE SECURITY
    // cipher: "aes-256-cbc",
    // passphrase: "satoshi nakamoto",
  },
});

// OK, LETS SEE HOW OUR KEYS LOOK

console.log(privateKey);
console.log(publicKey);

// WE WILL GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS

// WE WANT TO EXPORT OUR KEYS

module.exports = {
  privateKey,
  publicKey,
};

// BECAUSE WE NEED TO PUT THEM IN USE, WE WILL USE THEM IN
// SOMETHING CALLED
//                    ASYMETRIC ENCRIPTION

```

# 6. ASYMETRIC ENCRIPTION

HERE IS A GOOD DIAGRAM THAT SOWS HOW ASYMETRIC ENCRIOTION WORKS

![asymetric encription](/__NO_OPS/asymetricencription.png)

SO WE ENCRYPT BY USING PUBLIC KEY, AND THEN WE USE PRIVATE KEY TO DECRYPT

**GOOD EXPALE OF THIS IS HTTPS PROTOCOL OR SSL CERTIFICATE**

LETS SEE HOW ASYMETRIC ENCRIPTION CAN BE USED INSIDE NODEJS

FILE: `__NO_OPS/crypto-practice/6_asymetric_encription.js`

```js
// WE WILL USE THESE METHODS
const { publicEncrypt, privateDecrypt } = require("crypto");
// WE IMPORT OUR KEYS (REMEBER HOW WE MADE THEM) (CHECK FILE IF YOU WANT)
const { privateKey, publicKey } = require("./5_keypairs");

// LETS CREATE MESSAGE WE WANT TO ENCRYPT
const message = "Doge Coin is ponzi scheme!";

// console.log({ privateKey, publicKey });

// LETS NOW USE PUBLIC KEY TO ENCRYPT

// BUT WE NEED TO MAKE A BUFFER OF OUR MESSAGE FIRST

const encryptedMessageBuffer = publicEncrypt(publicKey, Buffer.from(message));

// LETS READ HEXADECIMAL VALUE FROM THE BUFFER

// JUST TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS, AND MAYBE WE CAN IMAGINE THAT WE ARE SENDING
// ENCRYPTED MESSAGE SOMEWHERE
const encryptedMessageHex = encryptedMessageBuffer.toString("hex");
// IMAGINE YOU WANT TO SEND THIS ENCRYPTION MESSAGE TO SOMEONE

console.log(`We are sending ${encryptedMessageHex} encrypted message BUFFER`);

// IMAGINE ENCRYPTED  CAME TO SOMEONE (CAME TO OTHER SERVER) WHO HAS PRIVATE KEY

// THEY WOULD FIRST MAKE A BUFFER FROM MENTIONED HEX
const bufferOfRecievedEncryptedMessage = Buffer.from(
  encryptedMessageHex,
  "hex"
);

// AND THEY WOULD THEN DECRYPT

const decryptedMessageBuffer = privateDecrypt(
  privateKey,
  bufferOfRecievedEncryptedMessage
);

// LETS READ THE BUFFER
// IT IS DECRYPTED
console.log(decryptedMessageBuffer.toString("utf-8")); // --> Doge Coin is ponzi scheme!

```

**ENCRYPTION IS FUN BUT IN MANY CASES, YOU DON'T NEED TO ACTUALLTY ENCRYPT DATA; INSTEAD YOU WANT TO VALIDATE THAT MESSAGE CAME FROM TRUSTED PART, `FOR THAT YOU NEED SIGNING` WHICH WE WILL EXPLORE BELLOW**

# 7. SIGNING

WHAT IS A DIGITAL SIGNATURE?

LETS SAY YOU ARE EXPRCTING LETTER WITH SOME SENSITIVE INFORMATIONS IN THE MAIL

YOU NEED TO ABLE TO REAST THAT THAT MESSAGE CAME FROM THE RIGHT PERSON; SO YOU REQUIRE FROM THEM TO SIGN THE LETTER IN BLOOD, AND IT ALSO CAN'T BE TEMPERED WITH SO THEY NEED TO PUT SPECIAL SEAL ON IT; AND IF A SEAL IS BROKEN, WE KNOW THAT LETTER WAS TEMPERED WITH

**DIGITAL SIGNATURES BASICALLY WORK INA A SIMILAR WAY I MENTIONED IN A STORY ABOVE**

- SENDER OF A MESSAGE WILL USE THEIR PRIVATE KEY TO SIGN A HASH OF THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE

- PRIVATE KEY GUARANTEES AUTHENTICITY (LIKE BLOOD)

- HASH GUARANTEES THAT MESSAGE CAN'T BE TEMPERED WITH; BECAUSE IT WOULD PRODUCE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SIGNATURE

- RECIPIENT CAN THEN USE PRIVATE KEY TO VALIDATE AUTHETICITY OF THE MESSAGE

**LETS CREATE SIGNATURE IN NODEJS**

FILE: `__NO_OPS/crypto-practice/7_signing.js`

```js
// WE WILL USE THESE FUNCTIONS
const { createSign, createVerify } = require("crypto");
// WE NEED OUR KEYS
const { privateKey, publicKey } = require("./5_keypairs");

// THIS IS A MESSAGE SOMEONE WANTS TO SEND TO US
const message = "Satoshi is the king, or he was";

// YTHEY WILL CREATE SIGNER
const signer = createSign("rsa-sha256"); // rsa algorythm + sha hashing algorythm

// THEY WILL JUST ADD THE MESSAGE TO THE SIGNER
signer.update(message);

// THAN THEY CREATE SIGNATURE WITH THEIR PRIVATE KEY
// SIGNATURE WILL BE IN HEX FORMAT
const signature = signer.sign(privateKey, "hex");

// IMAGINE NOW THAT THEY SENT MENTIONED HEX TO SOME OTHER PARTY,
// FOR EXMPLE TO US
// AND SINCE THEY TRUSTED US BEFORE, THEY GAVA TO US THEIR publicKey

console.log(
  `They are sending signature: ${signature} to you together with message: ${message}`
);

// RECEIVER. LIKE ME, SHOULD HAVE publicKey THEY PROVIDED TO ME


// I WILL CREATE VERIFIER
const verifier = createVerify("rsa-sha256");

// MESSAGE WE RECEIVE, NOW WE GIVE TO THE VERIFIER
verifier.update(message);

// USING PUBLIC KEY THEY PROVIDED TO US BEFORE (THEY TRUSST US LIKE I SAID),
//  AND A SIGNTURE WE JUST RECEIVED,
//  AND WE ASUME FORMAT OF THE SIGNATURE
// WE VERIFY, IF PARTY WE TRUST SENDED US A MESSAGE
const isVerified = verifier.verify(publicKey, signature, "hex");

// IF THIS IS TRUE (SHOULD BE true WITH DATE WE USED)
// WE CAN VERIFY THAT THE PARTY WE EXPECTED ACTUALLY SENT US A MESSAGE
console.log(isVerified);

//  ------ PAY ATTENTION THAT SIGNATURE IS HERE THE IMPORTANT THING
// ------ IF SIGNATURE WAS TAMPERED OR FORGD, VERIFICATION WOULD FAIL, 

// ---- OR IF message WAS TAMPERED WITH, VERIFICATION WOULD FAIL 

```
