# STARTING

```
docker-compose up
```

# SHUTTING DOWN

```
docker-compose down
```

# RUNNING BASH INSIDE CONTAINER

```
docker-compose run <name-of-the-service> bash
```

IN OUR CASE NAME OF THE SERVICE (NOT THE NAME OF THE CONTAINER) WHERE POSTGRES IS RUNNING IS `fancy-shiba-serv`)

## RUNNING `psql` (AFTER WE CONNECTED WITH THE BASH)

AFTER WE OPENED THE BASH BY UPPER COMMAND; WE CAN NOW RUN `psql`

YOU USE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES WE SET UP IN COMPOSE FILE

```
psql --host <name of the service> --username=<datbase username> --dbname=<datbase name>
```

IN OUR CASE, FOR POSTGRES THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF THE COMMAND

```
psql --host fancy-shiba-serv --username=themata --dbname=fancy-shiba-dev-db
```

note: **YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR THE PASSWORD AND WE ENTER PASSWORD WE SETTED UP INSIDE COMPOSE FILE,, UNDER `environment`**

# YOU CAN SEE THAT I MADE SOME SCRIPTS WHERE I IMPLEMENTED UPPER COMMANDS

ONLY LAST ONE, SINCE IT IS RUNNED ONLY INSIDE CONTAINE DOESN'T HAVE SCRIPT
