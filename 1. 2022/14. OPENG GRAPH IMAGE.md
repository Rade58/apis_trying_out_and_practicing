# WE ARE GOING TO GENERATE SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE (OPEN GRAPH IMAGE), DURING BUILD TIME, ON THE SPOT, WITH USAGE OF CLOUDINARY 

WE CAN USE PACKAGE [@jlengstorf/get-share-image](https://github.com/jlengstorf/get-share-image), **BUT I DECIDED NOT TO USE THIS, BECAUSE SOMEHOW, PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS BAD**

**AND I THINK THAT CLOUDINARY HAS IT'S OWN NODEJS CLIENT FOR GENERATING URLS**

INSTEAD, I'LL FOLLOW [THIS TUTORIAL](https://braydoncoyer.dev/blog/how-to-dynamically-create-open-graph-images-with-cloudinary-and-next.js), AND WRITE MY OWN IMPLEMENTATION

WE CAN FOLLOW THIS TOO 
<https://www.contentful.com/blog/2021/09/08/personalized-image-social-sharing-with-cloudinary-nextjs/>

**BUT FIRST, LETS MAKE A DESIGN IN FIGMA**

THIS I THINK CAN BE A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR URL THAT IS BUILT WITH CLOUDINARY

<https://res.cloudinary.com/jlengstorf/image/upload/w_1280,h_669,c_fill,q_auto,f_auto/w_813,c_fit,co_rgb:ffffff,g_south_west,x_392,y_385,l_text:jwf.otf_55:Automatic%20Social%20Images/w_813,c_fit,co_rgb:ffffff,g_north_west,x_392,y_320,l_text:jwf-book.otf_42:Custom%20images%20for%20sharing%20on%20Twitter%252C%20Facebook%252C%20and%20more!/lwj/post-share>

BUT THIS IMAGE IS USING `WEBP` FORMAT
