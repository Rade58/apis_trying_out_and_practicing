# IF YOU WANT TO HAVE TWO GITHUB ACCOUNT

LETS SAY YOU CREATED SSH CONFIG LIKE THIS, AND YOU HAVE TWO GITHUB ACCOUNTS, AND YOU ALREDY CREATED SSH KEYS ADDED PUBLIC ONES TO YOUR GITH ACCOUNT

AND THE IDEI IS THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE MULTIPLE REPOS AND ONE PUSH TO ONE GITHUB CCOUNT AND OTHER REPO TO THE OTHER GITHUB ACCOUNT

YOU CREATE FILE LIKE THIS

ONLY IMPORTANT THING IN THE FILE ARE PATHS TO THE KEYS IN THE .ssh FOLDER

```
# Rade58
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key1

# RadeDevOne
Host github.com-radedevone
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key2

```

**NOW COMS THEE IMPORTANT THING**

**YOU **
