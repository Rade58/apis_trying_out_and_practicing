# IF YOU WANT TO HAVE TWO GITHUB ACCOUNT

LETS SAY YOU CREATED SSH CONFIG LIKE THIS, AND YOU HAVE TWO GITHUB ACCOUNTS, AND YOU ALREDY CREATED SSH KEYS ADDED PUBLIC ONES TO YOUR GITH ACCOUNT

AND THE IDEI IS THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE MULTIPLE REPOS AND ONE PUSH TO ONE GITHUB CCOUNT AND OTHER REPO TO THE OTHER GITHUB ACCOUNT

YOU CREATE FILE LIKE THIS

ONLY IMPORTANT THING IN THE FILE ARE PATHS TO THE KEYS IN THE .ssh FOLDER

```
touch ~/.ssh/config 
```

```
# Rade58
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key1

# Rade2
Host github.com-radeother
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key2

```

**NOW COMS THEE IMPORTANT THING**

**YOU `NEED TO PAY ATTENTION HOW YOU'RE ADDING REMOTE ORIGIN OF YOUR REPO`**

YOU NEED TO ADD REMOTE ORIGIN LIKE THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO PUSH TO THE THAT REPO IF IT IS OWNED BY OUTR SECONF GITHUB ACCOUNT

SEE HOW I SPECIFIED `radeother` BELLOW (I JUST INSETED THAT ONE WORD "radeother" BECAUSE WE DID NAME IT LIKE THIS IN OUR)

```
git remote add origin git@github.com-radeother:Rade2/1_parrot_gif.git
```

NOW WHEN YOU TRY PUSHING, YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO DO THIS, BECAUSE THE RIGHT SSH KEY IS GOING TO BE USED

YOU CAN DO THIS AND THE RIGHT SSH IS GOING TO BE PICKED

```
git push -u origin main
```
