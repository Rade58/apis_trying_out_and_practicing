## NEKI CITAT O CACHING-U

>> If you have control over your own CDN, there's nothing stopping you from just caching it yourself in the network layer. By creating a custom digest, that's basically what we do. We write our own CDN in JavaScript and we just cache it based on the postbody and we kind of go from there.

>> If we're using something like fast.io or fly.io, and you can create your own CDN with JavaScript. Then you can just create a digest yourself from the postbody, which is a unique URL, then you can cache on that key. So you can cache on your own key that you created from the digest there and you can cache on the network level.
