            It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is an American sitcom that first premiered on FX on August 4,
            2005 and has since moved to FXX beginning with the ninth season. It was created by Rob McElhenney
            who developed it with Glenn Howerton. It is executive produced and primarily written by McElhenney,
            Howerton, and Charlie Day, all of whom star alongside Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito.
            The series follows the exploits of "The Gang", a group of debauched, nihilistic, self-centered,
            politically incorrect friends who run the Irish bar Paddy's Pub in South Philadelphia.
            On April 1, 2016, the series was renewed for a 13th and 14th season, which will tie it with
            The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet as the longest running (in number of seasons) live-action
            sitcom in American TV history.[2] Season 13 premiered on September 5, 2018.
            The series follows "The Gang", a group of five fictional misfit friends: twins Dennis (Glenn Howerton)
            and Deandra "Sweet Dee" Reynolds (Kaitlin Olson), their friends Charlie Kelly (Charlie Day) and Ronald
            "Mac" McDonald (Rob McElhenney), and (from season 2 onward) Frank Reynolds (Danny DeVito), Dennis' and
            Dee's legal father. The Gang runs the fictional Paddy's Pub, a dilapidated Irish bar located in South
            Philadelphia.
            Each member of "The Gang" shows behavior that would be considered unethical by today's standards,
            such as excessive drinking and traits such as dishonesty and egotism. Episodes usually find them
            hatching elaborate schemes and often conspiring against one another and others for personal gain,
            vengeance, or simply the entertainment of watching another's downfall.
            They habitually inflict mental, emotional, and physical pain on each other and anyone who crosses
            their path. They also regularly use blackmail to manipulate one another and others outside of the group.

            Howerton, and Charlie Day, all of whom star alongside Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito.
            The series follows the exploits of "The Gang", a group of debauched, nihilistic, self-centered,
            politically incorrect friends who run the Irish bar Paddy's Pub in South Philadelphia.
            On April 1, 2016, the series was renewed for a 13th and 14th season, which will tie it with
            The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet as the longest running (in number of seasons) live-action
            sitcom in American TV history.[2] Season 13 premiered on September 5, 2018.
            The series follows "The Gang", a group of five fictional misfit friends: twins Dennis (Glenn Howerton)
            and Deandra "Sweet Dee" Reynolds (Kaitlin Olson), their friends Charlie Kelly (Charlie Day) and Ronald
            "Mac" McDonald (Rob McElhenney), and (from season 2 onward) Frank Reynolds (Danny DeVito), Dennis' and
            Dee's legal father. The Gang runs the fictional Paddy's Pub, a dilapidated Irish bar located in South
            Philadelphia.
            Each member of "The Gang" shows behavior that would be considered unethical by today's standards,
            such as excessive drinking and traits such as dishonesty and egotism. Episodes usually find them
            hatching elaborate schemes and often conspiring against one another and others for personal gain,
            vengeance, or simply the entertainment of watching another's downfall.
            They habitually inflict mental, emotional, and physical pain on each other and anyone who crosses
            their path. They also regularly use blackmail to manipulate one another and others outside of the group.
