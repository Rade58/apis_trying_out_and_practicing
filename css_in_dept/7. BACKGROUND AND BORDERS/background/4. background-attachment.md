<div class="bear">
The English word "bear" comes from Old English bera and belongs to a family
of names for the bear in Germanic languages, such as Swedish björn, also used as a first
name, that originate from an adjective meaning "brown". "Bear" therefore originally meant
"the brown one." This terminology for the animal originated as a taboo avoidance term:
proto-Germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear – arkto – with this
euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal's true name might cause it to
appear.

<div class="city">
A city is distinguished from other human settlements by its relatively great
size, but also by its functions and its special symbolic status, which may be conferred by a
central authority. The term can also refer either to the physical streets and buildings of the
city or to the collection of people who dwell there, and can be used in a general sense to
mean urban rather than rural territory.
