    <h2>From wikipedia about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave">Synthwave</a></h2>

        Synthwave was inspired by many 1980s films, video games, and cartoons,[8] as well as composers such as
        John Carpenter, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream[4][9][10], however the genre itself arose from electronic
        dance music genres including house, synth, and nu-disco.[11]
        The subgenre name "outrun" comes from the 1986 driving arcade game Out Run, which was known for its
        soundtrack that could be selected in-game.[9] According to musician Perturbator (James Kent), the style is mainly
        instrumental, and often contains 1980s cliché elements in the sound such as electronic drums, gated reverb, and
        analog synthesizer bass lines and leads, all to resemble tracks from that time period.[12]
        This aesthetic has been incorporated into retro themed movies and video games featuring synthwave artists.
        According to Bryan Young of Glitchslap, one of the most notable examples of this is Power Glove's soundtrack
        to the 2013 video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.[3] Another popular example of the genre crossing into other
        media is David Sandberg's short film Kung Fury.

        The release of the movie Drive in 2011, whose soundtrack featured several synthwave artists, helped
        drive new fans and artists inspired by it toward the genre.[14][15] Following the various influxes of
        new artists into the genre, several of these artists gravitated toward specific aspects of synthwave
        carved out by the early artists, leading to a wide variation in styles between artists who are
        associated with the genre. [16] Nerdglow's Christopher Higgins cited Electric Youth and Kavinsky
        as the two most popular artists in synthwave in 2014.[8] Since 2015, synthwave has reached a broader
        audience from outside musicians and popular media.[17]
        Fashwave (a portmanteau of "fascist" and "synthwave"),[18] is a largely instrumental subgenre of synthwave
        and vaporwave, with political track titles and occasional soundbites,[19] that originated on YouTube circa
        2015.[20] The phenomenon was described as self-identified fascists and alt-right members appropriating
        vaporwave music and aesthetics.
