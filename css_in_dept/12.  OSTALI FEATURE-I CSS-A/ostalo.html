                Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes
                drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Justin Chancellor has been
                the band's bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy
                Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.
                The band emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and later became a
                dominant act in the alternative metal movement, with the release of their second album, Ænima in 1996.
                Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued,
                with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album, 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim,
                and commercial success around the world.
                Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally
                described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock.
                The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship,
                and the band's insistence on privacy.

                Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally
                described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock.
                The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship,

                Synthwave was inspired by many 1980s films, video games, and cartoons,[8] as well as composers such as
                John Carpenter, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream[4][9][10], however the genre itself arose from electronic
                dance music genres including house, synth, and nu-disco.[11]
                The subgenre name "outrun" comes from the 1986 driving arcade game Out Run, which was known for its
                soundtrack that could be selected in-game.[9] According to musician Perturbator (James Kent), the style is mainly
                instrumental, and often contains 1980s cliché elements in the sound such as electronic drums, gated reverb, and
                analog synthesizer bass lines and leads, all to resemble tracks from that time period.[12]
                This aesthetic has been incorporated into retro themed movies and video games featuring synthwave artists.
                According to Bryan Young of Glitchslap, one of the most notable examples of this is Power Glove's soundtrack
                to the 2013 video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.[3] Another popular example of the genre crossing into other
                media is David Sandberg's short film Kung Fury.

                The release of the movie Drive in 2011, whose soundtrack featured several synthwave artists, helped
                drive new fans and artists inspired by it toward the genre.[14][15] Following the various influxes of
                new artists into the genre, several of these artists gravitated toward specific aspects of synthwave
                carved out by the early artists, leading to a wide variation in styles between artists who are
                associated with the genre. [16] Nerdglow's Christopher Higgins cited Electric Youth and Kavinsky
                as the two most popular artists in synthwave in 2014.[8] Since 2015, synthwave has reached a broader
                audience from outside musicians and popular media.[17]
                Fashwave (a portmanteau of "fascist" and "synthwave"),[18] is a largely instrumental subgenre of synthwave
                and vaporwave, with political track titles and occasional soundbites,[19] that originated on YouTube circa
                2015.[20] The phenomenon was described as self-identified fascists and alt-right members appropriating
                vaporwave music and aesthetics.

            The release of the movie Drive in 2011, whose soundtrack featured several synthwave artists, helped
